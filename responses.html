                <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="text-left p-2 px-5">This article discusses the concept of "Big Ball of Mud" software and the advantages it has over "architecture astronaut" software. The main argument behind the “Big Ball of Mud” software is that even though it may not be written in the most well thought out architectural form, it gets functioning software out the door that users are able to give feedback on. This feedback is crucial to the development process because it allows developers to begin tailoring the software towards its end goal - a functional program that users enjoy using to solve the problems they are working on. The danger behind spending too much time and energy planning out the architecture of a program is that you are not getting feedback from the people the program is being developed for. We live is very fast paced society and the problems and needs of consumers are constantly changing. If a usable product is unable to get out the door in time, developers risk spending time solving problems of the past.  </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="text-left p-2 px-5">I found this article to be inspiring because it subtly argues that you don't have to be a genius to write a good functioning program. However, I still feel that have a well thought out architectural plan for a program is good to have for stronger, robust programs. It seems that there needs to be a balance found, where a program is able to being structurally strong, yet able to be produced in a matter of time that is still relevant to the problems it is being written for. With that said, I am not yet an experienced programmer, so I don’t know how valid my opinion is on this matter yet. Overall, I thought this was an interesting read, providing a new perspective writing software.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="text-left p-2 px-5">DevOps is a culture that is sweeping the software development industry and proving to be one of the best ways to produce high functioning software. It comes from the words “development operations” and is sort of an extension to Agile development. In essence, DevOps is a way to develop software with tight communication and collaboration between everybody in the development and operations personnel of a business. By having strong communication between everyone, software is able to be made faster and keep up with the ever changing demands of the customers.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;" class="text-left p-2 px-5">Hand-in-hand with the DevOps movement is the usage of cloud for applications. The combination of DevOps with cloud allows for a fast life cycle of development. This life cycle includes phases of Thinking, Coding, Delivering, Running, Managing, and Learning. From executives to test engineers to developers, everybody has their place within the cycle. The automation of a continuous cycle of product releases has concretely shown to yield high functioning and robust software that is able to keep up with the needs of customer.</p>
